I want to make a rock paper scissor game with a little twist
- each round can deal damage, if you win you get streaks
- after 2 win streaks you get a shield card that you can use, after you use it the card resets and you need to win again to get it back
- the bot slightly biases against user's most common recent move
- if user pick move within 5 seconds gain 10% more score pts
- make levels : easy, medium, and hard mode
- play until health bar reaches 0 and the game resets
